# üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zulker-Nien/tbay.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tbay
   ```

3. Initialize the submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule init
   
   # This part initializes the repository links of the respective submodules
   ```

4. Populate the submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update

   # This part pulls the data inside of each of the respective submodules
   # Perform a pull request 
   ```

5. Build your project:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```
   `The --no-cache flag forces Docker to rebuild all layers from scratch, ignoring cached layers.`

6. Start all the processes:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

#### You now have installed everything and the instances are running.
Go to `http://localhost:5173`

### üìö Scripts

- The prisma generate and seed functions are handled automatically so you do not need to manually run them.
- Run **`docker-compose exec backend npx prisma migrate`** for any schema migration `to be done only after running docker-compose up`


### üîë Environment Variables

`You don't need to create environment variables. I have already added required envs to the docker-compose.yml file`

- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency.


### ‚ïî Corner Cases Handled

- Logged in users cannot go to the signin/ register pages via the unprotected routes.
- Validation upon every step of the create form.
- Instantly handles the refetching of the created data.
- Updated cart is shown instantly.

### ‚ïù Corner Cases Not Handled

- Fetching tokens over http-only cookies. Currently stored in localhost.
- Cart Items cannot be edited, only deleted
- If user A has an item in cart, and another user buys the item prior to user A resulting in an out of stock exception, the user A will be posed with an error only after ordering. `Whereas: the cart should be disabled in the first place.` 
- Navigation in mobile screen not updated.

### Comments

- A design system could help add better visual aspects of the clientside
- Role based Authentication could turn it into an actual secured product.
- Prisma ORM handles the Database relations by itself. While it automates, the ERD contains unnecessary additions. `TypeORM/MikroORM in my opinion provides with more manual access and validation functionality`
- Ability to extent rent period and return rented products to update product stock accordingly could be added.
- Wishlist, product rating, coupons and discount could also be incorporated.
